<h2>Trip Information</h2>
<p>Our Service allows you to connect with a Bluetooth OBD-II device in your vehicle. While traveling, the device and Service will generate trip information. On completion of the trip, the information generated can be viewed in the Service. For shared vehicles, trip information is not shown on other user's applications but the total vehicle shared mileage is.</p>

<h2>Changes</h2>
<p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material we will try to provide at least two (2) weeks notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.</p>
