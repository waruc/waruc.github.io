<h2>FAQ</h2>
<p>Do you need to buy a Bluetooth OBD-II device to connect?</p>
<p>-- Yes, it is a core part of how the application functions.</p><br>
<p>Does your team have knowledge on policy matters regarding the RUC?</p>
<p>-- No, we can direct you to resources about the policy but our team does not handle policy matters not directly involving the application.</p><br>
<p>What if the mileage reported on the application is different from on my odometer?</p>
<p>-- The mileage we report is calculated, as is more acurate than your odometer, if it is off there is nothing to worry about. If you feel we have incorrectly calculated your mileage on a trip feel free to contact us.</p>
